# Protocol 3: Dilution

## Materials
- [ ] PCR A products from [Protocol 2: Primary PCR](https://github.com/bpetrone/mb-pipeline/blob/84c03c17be745f4703d43497eed5f8ed10653c57/protocols/2_primary_pcr.md)
- [ ] Nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O

## Protocol
**Location:** Clean, post-PCR processing lab bench.
**Note:** This protocol assumes that ~5 ul of primary PCR product remains in the reaction plate after running products on a gel.
- [ ]  Add 45 ul of water to remaining volume (~5 ul) in each PCR A sample well (1:10 dilution).
- [ ]  Mix by gently pipetting up and down 10X.
- [ ]  Transfer 5 ul of the 1:10 dilution to a new plate.
- [ ]  Add 45 ul of water to the 1:10 dilution to make a 1:100 dilution.  
- [ ]  Mix by gently pipetting up and down 10X.
- [ ]  Seal plate with foil, store in refridgerator for short-term use, or proceed directly to [Protocol 4: Indexing PCR](https://github.com/bpetrone/mb-pipeline/blob/dfafcbb40f3d22f5a231bf532930bf5d98162f80/protocols/4_indexing_pcr.md).  Store 1:10 dilution plate in freezer as back-up.
